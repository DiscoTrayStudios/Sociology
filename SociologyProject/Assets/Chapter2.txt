Culteral Competency training and positive behavior support are great ways to help prevent this issue.

:: UniformA[Character D]
We're going to need some decisions from you, Mr. Johnson.
We received many complaints from parents about the clothes some of the girls at this school are wearing.
It is not appropriate for a school setting, and I hope we see some stricter enforcement of the rules.
So? What are your thoughts?
Address the singling out of females in an assembly[[AdressIssue]]
Create a stricter dress-code for students[[StrictCode]]

:: AdressIssue[Character D]
Interesting. That sounds like a good decision to me.

:: UniformB[Character D]
Mr. Johnson! We can't be cutting so much slack for students who come to school without a proper uniform.
I know you work closely with the parents and students, so I need you to find a solution that upholds the pride of our school.
Allow uniform purchases through voucher system[[Vouchers]]
Issue suspensions to students without uniforms[[Suspensions]]

Hey Mr. Johnson, do you know if there's any room for our school to request cultural competency training this year?
I've been reading up on some studies recently, and I think it could really help our school.

chelsea almost got in a lot of trouble today
but she said that after class mr borrow talked to her
and apparently he felt that he shouldnt have gotten her in trouble when he did.
ive never seen a teacher do that before.
