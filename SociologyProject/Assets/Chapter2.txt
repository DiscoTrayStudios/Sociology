:: UniformA
We’re going to need some decisions from you, Mr. Johnson.
We received many complaints from parents about the clothes some of the girls at this school are wearing.
It is not appropriate for a school setting, and I hope we see some stricter enforcement of the rules.
So? What are your thoughts?
Address the singling out of female dress code in an assembly[[AdressIssue]]
Create a stricter dress-code for students[[StrictCode]]

:: AdressIssue
Interesting. That sounds like a good decision to me.
Next[[CulturalCompetency]]

:: StrictCode
I’ll leave the execution in your hands!
Next[[CulturalCompetency]]

:: UniformB
Mr. Johnson! We can’t be cutting so much slack for students who come to school without a proper uniform.
I know you work closely with the parents and students, so I need you to find a solution that upholds the pride of our school.
Allow uniform purchases through voucher system[[Vouchers]]
Issue suspensions to students without uniforms[[Suspensions]]

:: Vouchers
I trust that this is the right decision
Next[[CulturalCompetency]]

:: Suspensions
See to it that it works
Next[[CulturalCompetency]]

:: CulturalCompetency
Hey Mr. Johnson, do you know if there’s any room for our school to request cultural competency training this year?
I’ve been reading up on some studies recently, and I think it could really help our school.
Request Cultural Competency Training from the state[[RequestTraining]]
Stick with the originally planned schedule[[OriginalTraining]]

:: RequestTraining
Great! I’ll put in the request now.
Next[[CutScene]]

:: OriginalTraining
Oh, really. I guess there’s just no room, huh?
