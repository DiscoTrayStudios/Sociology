Mrs. Williams, do you have a moment?
State legislature passed allowing us to station a school resource officer in all high schools.
These officers have really helped with discipline in the past.
However, there is a school requesting a counselor instead.
We wouldn’t be able to hire that counselor with money from the bill. Should we give them the funding?
Allow the exception for the school[[AllowException]]
Stick to the plan, send an SRO[[SRO]]

:: AllowException
Yes ma’am, we will follow through with your plan. Take care.

Mrs. Williams, I wanted to stop you and ask your advice about something.
It has come to my attention recently that there is a group of students protesting the theme of one of this years’ fun dress-up days before homecoming.
The student government this year set the last day to be ‘Freedom Friday’ but there is a group of students saying that they don’t feel included.
Do you think this should require faculty involvement, or should this be something I leave to the student government who introduced it?
Get the faculty involved[[FacultyInvolved]]
Leave it to the students[[LeavetoStudents]]

:: FacultyInvolved
I always appreciate your advice. I’ll take it into account.
Have a good rest of your day.
