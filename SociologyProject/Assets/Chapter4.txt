Hi Parker, do you have a moment? When I was in High School we had a club called Students for Black Culture.
It was a really great place for me to talk to other students of color, and I was really hoping to join something similar when I came here.
I don't feel like it's something I can start myself. Is there anything you could do?
Let's make this club![[MakeClub]]
There's currently not room in the budget[[NoBudget]]

:: MakeClub
Thanks so much! I'll be sure to join.

Parker, do you have a moment?
Administration says that a portion of the recent big donation is going to some of our sports teams.
Do you have any thoughts on where that money should go?
Well the football team is the biggest team…[[FootballTeam]]
Maybe we should fund multiple smaller teams.[[SmallerTeams]]

:: FootballTeam[PreCutScene]
Thanks for your support! I'll pass your word on.

Thinking about post-college decisions.
Not sure what to do or where to go,
but I'm glad I am where I am.

So that people stop asking, yeah I dropped college.
It came down to a money thing
and I didn't feel like I belonged there anyway.
So stop dming me about it.

:: CutSceneGood[END CutScene]
Excited to announce here that I was accepted
into an internship at NASA for the next year!
I'm starting in June!!
